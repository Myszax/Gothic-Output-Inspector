# Gothic Output Inspector
## What is it?
It is an application which you can use to open Gothic (game) OU (output) files.
Application will automatically parse .bin file (currently only Bin-Safe is supported) then group dialogues/trialogues/svm by NPC.
Support its own project files *.goi*
Audio files are also supported. Audio player has options to play/pause/stop/set position/mute/unmute/change volume.
## How to use it?
### Start from scratch
First choose encoding **Settings > Encoding** (default *windows-1250* is chosen). Then **File > Import OU File** to import ***OU.bin*** file.
Now you will be able to save project.
**Settings > Path to audio files...** you can choose folder where **.wav** audio files are stored.
## Work in progress
There is still much to do :)
- Add dictionaries (currently only Polish works)
- Compare different **OU** files / **.goi** projects
- More export options
